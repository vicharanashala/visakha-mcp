The Ejection Policy ensures that program resources are dedicated to committed learners and that prolonged disengagement does not dilute the experience for others."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "What are the types of ejection in this program?",
      "answer": "There are two types of ejection: Forward Eject (The Ascent): Participants who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance, sustained momentum, and high engagement may be elevated to advanced opportunities such as leadership roles, advanced responsibilities, or fellowship considerations. Backward Eject (The Departure): Participants who remain persistently inactive or disengaged may be removed from the program to preserve the quality and seriousness of the cohort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "What does 'Backward Eject' mean?",
      "answer": "Backward Eject refers to the removal of a participant from the internship due to sustained inactivity. This ensures that collaborative learning activities are conducted among participants who are actively contributing and progressing."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "How is inactivity measured for Backward Ejection?",
      "answer": "Backward Ejection is triggered only if both conditions are met simultaneously: 1. Your average daily progress on the ViBe platform falls below 3.33% per day, and 2. Your overall engagement level places you within the bottom 10% of the active cohort. This dual-condition check ensures fairness and prevents short-term slowdowns from being penalized."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Is the ejection process manual or automated?",
      "answer": "The process will be automated and data-driven. An algorithm objectively evaluates progress and cohort standing, ensuring transparency and eliminating subjective bias or manual intervention. Manual intervention at a higher level is currently in place to oversee the ejection and ensure correctness."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Can I avoid being ejected from the program?",
      "answer": "Yes. Maintaining steady progress above the minimum threshold and remaining actively engaged with the ViBe platform ensures that your position in the program remains secure."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Is the Ejection Policy the same as the Discontinuation Policy?",
      "answer": "No. The Discontinuation Policy addresses prolonged inactivity at an administrative level. The Ejection Policy is a real-time, algorithm-based mechanism focused on maintaining cohort momentum, engagement health, and learning quality."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Can I appeal an ejection decision?",
      "answer": "No. Ejection decisions are final and non-appealable, as they are based on objective, automated criteria applied uniformly across the cohort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Does being ejected affect future opportunities?",
      "answer": "Backward Ejection removes you from the current cohort only. Forward Ejection, however, may open pathways to advanced leadership roles or fellowship nominations based on demonstrated excellence and reflective learning practices."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "What is the Self-Healing Endorsement Network?",
      "answer": "The Self-Healing Endorsement Network is the official evaluation framework for the Case study activity completion for the learners. It is a peer-driven endorsement system where interns endorse each other's learning and contributions. All endorsements together form a connected endorsement network. For the network to remain valid: Every chain of endorsements must ultimately connect to a certified 'Jedi' (i.e., a Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket holder), Any group of interns not connected to a Jedi forms a 'floating island', Floating islands are considered inactive, and endorsements within them will not be counted."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "Who are the Jedi and what role do they play?",
      "answer": "A Jedi is an intern who holds a Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket. Their role in the network: All endorsement paths must eventually link to a Jedi, Jedi act as anchors that validate and legitimize endorsement chains."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "Is endorsement mandatory to complete the internship?",
      "answer": "Yes, every non-Jedi intern must receive one valid endorsement to successfully complete the internship. Important points: Endorsements must be completed within the given deadline, The final endorsement graph must not contain any floating islands, Interns who remain unendorsed or disconnected risk non-completion of the internship."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "How many endorsements can I receive or give?",
      "answer": "Each intern can receive only one endorsement. An intern may endorse multiple other interns. There is no upper limit on how many endorsements you can give. However, a tree with greater length rather than breadth is encouraged to maintain strong, meaningful chains rather than shallow mass endorsements."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "When am I allowed to endorse someone?",
      "answer": "You may endorse anyone at your discretion, after assessing them in any way you find appropriate. Recommended best practices: Interact with the intern before endorsing them, Ensure they demonstrate sufficient understanding of the MERN stack, ViBe course content, and case studies, Maintain a healthy and collaborative interaction — there is no hierarchy or superiority among co-interns, so please ensure that you interact with your co-interns in a friendly manner as peers. Important Warning: Endorsing someone with inadequate MERN fundamentals may trigger audit penalties for the entire tree or subtree connected to that endorsement."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "Can I endorse or be endorsed by someone from my own college?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is allowed. However: Endorsements within the same institute may raise suspicion, Such connections have a higher probability of being audited by Bhavna ma'am. This is not prohibited, but interns are expected to endorse responsibly and ethically."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "How do audits work in the endorsement network?",
      "answer": "Audits are conducted by Bhavna to identify interns who need improvement and work on Case studies before they get into the project phase. If a Needs Improvement intern is identified: The entire endorsement path connected to that intern is audited, A 50% health point penalty is applied to everyone in that connected group, The intern and anyone who fails the audit are removed from the network."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "What happens if I am certified as 'good' during an audit?",
      "answer": "If an intern is certified as 'good' by Bhavna ma'am: They become eligible to be endorsed by anyone, even if they were previously disconnected, Their credibility and trust score within the network increases."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network",
      "question": "What incentives exist within the endorsement network?",
      "answer": "The network is intentionally designed to be self-healing and incentive-driven. Whenever a new intern joins a valid connected endorsement group: Every existing member receives a 5% health point increase. The increase is calculated as: 5% of their current health points, plus 5% of the new member's health points. This encourages: Formation of strong, connected networks, Avoidance of risky or isolated endorsement chains."
    },
    {
