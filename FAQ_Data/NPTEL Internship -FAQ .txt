4.1. Where do I raise my concern initially?
   * Please send an email to internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in.
   * Our support team will respond within 2 hours of your submission (9 AM to 9 PM). Any question submitted beyond 9 PM will be answered the next day.
4.2. What if I don’t receive a response in 24 hours?
If you do not receive a response within 24 hours, you may raise a second ticket.
In the subject line, mention:"Attention Please – Follow-up on Ticket #[Original Ticket Number]"
This ticket will be escalated to our Mentors Team, who will reach out to you for a voice call discussion and try to resolve the issue directly.
4.3. Who will respond to my second ticket?
The Mentors Team will handle the second ticket and schedule a voice call to ensure your issue is clearly understood and resolved.
4.4. If my concern still isn’t addressed, how do I escalate further?
After 48 hours of your first ticket (and after raising a follow-up), you can escalate the matter via email to the Internship Sponsor, with CC to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar directly with the following recipients in CC:
   * Your department’s faculty reference
   * Your department HOD
   * The DLED Team at dled@iitrpr.ac.in

8. TERMINATION & REJOINING
8.1 I received a termination email due to overlapping academic commitments, but my exams are over now. Can I rejoin the current internship batch?
No. The internship is a full-time commitment, and any academic overlap, even if temporary, disqualifies a participant from continuing. You will need to apply again for the next available internship batch if interested.
8.2 Can I appeal my termination if I have valid reasons for missing assignments or sessions?
The internship policy allows no leniency. If you have already received an official termination notice due to either lack of attendance, late submissions, or academic overlap, your internship cannot be reinstated. The rules are strict to maintain fairness and program quality.
8.3 I plan to rejoin the internship later. Will it be the same program?
If you wish to participate again, you must reapply and go through the selection process for the next batch. Please note that future internships may not be funded by any organization or IIT Ropar.
