    },
    {
      "category": "ViBe Platform",
      "question": "I have completed all videos and quizzes in the ViBe course, but my progress is still showing less than 100%. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Please do not worry. This is a **dashboard-level technical issue** that has already been acknowledged by the support team and communicated. The team is actively working on resolving it, and your progress will be **updated automatically** once the issue is fixed.\nIn the meantime, you may try the following steps once:\n1. **Refresh your browser**\n2. **Log out**, clear your browser cache, and **log in again**\nIf the issue still persists after these steps, no further action is required from your side. Your course completion status will be corrected by the support team shortly."
    },
    {
      "category": "ViBe Platform",
      "question": "I feel the ViBe content or platform is not good or I am unhappy with the way progress is evaluated. Can I request an exception or bypass the system?",
      "answer": "ViBe is built and continuously improved by interns and students themselves. It is a free and open-source learning platform, and our goal is to keep it that way by encouraging the community to actively contribute, improve, and strengthen it rather than bypass it.\nIf a learner strongly feels that the regular ViBe flow does not fairly reflect their understanding, there is a formal alternative evaluation path. However, this path is intentionally rigorous to ensure fairness for everyone.\nIn such cases, you will be asked to:\n- Watch the specified YouTube video content completely (links will be provided).\n- Appear for a three-hour proctored examination based only on that content.\n- Write the exam under strict supervision with:\n- Two cameras (front and side view), and\n- One online human proctor monitoring you live.\nThis examination becomes the sole basis for evaluation in place of the regular internship track.\nThe scoring rules are strict:\n- **Score below 60%**: You are considered not qualified and must join the next cohort and continue only through the normal ViBe mode.\n- **Score between 60% and 80%**: You get one more chance in the next scheduled exam.\n- **Score above 80%**: You are considered to have passed.\nThis special exam is conducted once every fortnight, so choosing this route may significantly delay your progress compared to continuing normally on ViBe.\nBecause this path is far more demanding and time-consuming than simply completing the regular videos, quizzes, and activities, most students find that continuing with the standard ViBe workflow is the faster and better option."
    },
    {
      "category": "MERN Case Studies",
      "question": "What are Case Studies?",
      "answer": "Case studies are the **second required component** (Advanced Learning) of the Vinternship program. They are well-structured, documentation-based lessons designed to help you apply what you learned in ViBe training through **hands-on coding**. Each case study focuses on real-world problem-solving, collaborative thinking, and practical implementation to help you become more confident with the technologies covered.\nCase studies are organized by technology, including:\n- TypeScript Fundamentals\n- React Development\n- Express.js Backend\n- MongoDB Database\nEach case study includes:\n- Clear problem statements\n- Defined learning objectives\n- Step-by-step explanations\n- Practical coding tasks\n- Best practices and recommended patterns"
    },
    {
      "category": "MERN Case Studies",
      "question": "Are Case Studies mandatory?",

    },
    {
      "category": "MERN Case Studies",
      "question": "How do I get started with Case Studies?",
      "answer": "After completing all ViBe MERN modules:\n1. Click the **Case Studies** link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.\n2. Select a **technology** and then choose a **lesson**.\n3. Read the entire documentation carefully to understand the concept and tasks to be performed.\n4. Try to understand each case study first, then attempt to code a solution for it.\n5. Open a code editor (for example, **VS Code**) and implement the tasks.\n5. Getting stuck is normal. You can ask queries to the support desk, revisit the ViBe videos, and discuss with others.\n7. Submit your work using the submission link provided on your cohort specific page."
    },
    {
      "category": "MERN Case Studies",
      "question": "What comes after Case Studies?",
      "answer": "After completing case studies, you move ahead to the Endorsement phase. The Self-healing endorsement network is a peer evaluation strategy that the learner needs to accomplish before getting into the next phase. The learner is expected to take an endorsement from a peer and move ahead to the third component that is **Practical Learning (Projects)**. Please visit - [The Self-Healing Endorsement Network page]({{ site.baseurl }}/endorsements/) to learn more about endorsements."
    },

    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "What is the Ejection Policy?",
      "answer": "The Ejection Policy is a structured mechanism designed to maintain a high-energy, focused learning environment. It ensures that the internship cohort consists of actively engaged participants who are consistently making progress. The policy promotes momentum, accountability, and fairness across the cohort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Why does the program have an Ejection Policy?",
      "answer": "The policy exists to protect the learning ecosystem. Collaborative activities such as peer-to-peer viva sessions, case study discussions, and cohort-based learning are meaningful only when participants are equally invested. The Ejection Policy ensures that program resources are dedicated to committed learners and that prolonged disengagement does not dilute the experience for others."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "What are the types of ejection in this program?",
      "answer": "There are **two types of ejection**:\n- **Forward Eject (The Ascent):**\nParticipants who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance, sustained momentum, and high engagement may be elevated to advanced opportunities such as leadership roles, advanced responsibilities, or fellowship considerations.\n- **Backward Eject (The Departure):**\nParticipants who remain persistently inactive or disengaged may be removed from the program to preserve the quality and seriousness of the cohort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "What does “Backward Eject” mean?",
      "answer": "Backward Eject refers to the removal of a participant from the internship due to sustained inactivity. This ensures that collaborative learning activities are conducted among participants who are actively contributing and progressing."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "How is inactivity measured for Backward Ejection?",
      "answer": "Backward Ejection is triggered **only if both conditions are met simultaneously**:\n1. Your average daily progress on the ViBe platform falls **below 3.33% per day**, **and**\n2. Your overall engagement level places you within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.\nThis dual-condition check ensures fairness and prevents short-term slowdowns from being penalized."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Is the ejection process manual or automated?",
      "answer": "The process will be **automated and data-driven**. An algorithm objectively evaluates progress and cohort standing, ensuring transparency and eliminating subjective bias or manual intervention. Manual intervention at a higher level is currently in place to oversee the ejection and ensure correctness."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Can I avoid being ejected from the program?",
      "answer": "Yes. Maintaining steady progress above the minimum threshold and remaining actively engaged with the ViBe platform ensures that your position in the program remains secure."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Is the Ejection Policy the same as the Discontinuation Policy?",
      "answer": "No. The **Discontinuation Policy** addresses prolonged inactivity at an administrative level. The **Ejection Policy** is a real-time, algorithm-based mechanism focused on maintaining cohort momentum, engagement health, and learning quality."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Can I appeal an ejection decision?",
      "answer": "No. Ejection decisions are **final and non-appealable**, as they are based on objective, automated criteria applied uniformly across the cohort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ejection Policy",
      "question": "Does being ejected affect future opportunities?",
      "answer": "Backward Ejection removes you from the current cohort only. Forward Ejection, however, may open pathways to advanced leadership roles or fellowship nominations based on demonstrated excellence and reflective learning practices."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "What is the Self-Healing Endorsement Network?",
      "answer": "The **Self-Healing Endorsement Network** is the official evaluation framework for the Case study activity completion for the learners.\nIt is a **peer-driven endorsement system** where interns endorse each other’s learning and contributions. All endorsements together form a **connected endorsement network**.\nFor the network to remain valid:\n- Every chain of endorsements must **ultimately connect to a certified “Jedi”** (i.e., a **Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket holder**)\n- Any group of interns not connected to a Jedi forms a **floating island**\n- Floating islands are considered **inactive**, and endorsements within them **will not be counted**"
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "Who are the Jedi and what role do they play?",
      "answer": "A **Jedi** is an intern who holds a **Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket**.\nTheir role in the network:\n- All endorsement paths must **eventually link to a Jedi**\n- Jedi act as **anchors** that validate and legitimize endorsement chains"
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "Is endorsement mandatory to complete the internship?",
      "answer": "Yes, **every non-Jedi intern must receive one valid endorsement** to successfully complete the internship.\nImportant points:\n- Endorsements **must be completed within the given deadline**\n- The final endorsement graph must **not contain any floating islands**\n- Interns who remain **unendorsed or disconnected** risk **non-completion of the internship**"
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "How many endorsements can I receive or give?",
      "answer": "- Each intern can **receive only one endorsement**\n- An intern may **endorse multiple other interns**\n- There is **no upper limit** on how many endorsements you can give\nHowever, a **tree with greater length rather than breadth** is encouraged to maintain strong, meaningful chains rather than shallow mass endorsements."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "When am I allowed to endorse someone?",
      "answer": "You may endorse anyone **at your discretion**, after assessing them in any way you find appropriate.\nRecommended best practices:\n- Interact with the intern before endorsing them\n- Ensure they demonstrate **sufficient understanding of the MERN stack**, **ViBe course content**, and **case studies**\n- Maintain a **healthy and collaborative interaction** — there is **no hierarchy or superiority** among co-interns, so please ensure that you interact with your co-interns in a friendly manner as peers\n⚠️ **Important Warning:**\nEndorsing someone with **inadequate MERN fundamentals** may trigger **audit penalties** for the **entire tree or subtree** connected to that endorsement."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "Can I endorse or be endorsed by someone from my own college?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is **allowed**.\nHowever:\n- Endorsements within the **same institute may raise suspicion**\n- Such connections have a **higher probability of being audited** by **Bhavna ma’am**\nThis is **not prohibited**, but interns are expected to endorse **responsibly and ethically**."
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "How do audits work in the endorsement network?",
      "answer": "Audits are conducted by **Bhavna** to identify interns who need improvement and work on Case studies before they get into the project phase.\nIf a **Needs Improvement** intern is identified:\n- The **entire endorsement path** connected to that intern is audited\n- A **50% health point penalty** is applied to everyone in that connected group\n- The **intern and anyone who fails the audit** are **removed from the network**"
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "What happens if I am certified as “good” during an audit?",
      "answer": "If an intern is certified as **“good”** by Bhavna ma’am:\n- They become **eligible to be endorsed by anyone**, even if they were previously disconnected\n- Their **credibility and trust score** within the network increases"
    },
    {
      "category": "Self-Healing Endorsement Network - Viva/Peer Evaluation System(PES)",
      "question": "What incentives exist within the endorsement network?",
      "answer": "The network is intentionally designed to be **self-healing and incentive-driven**.\nWhenever a new intern joins a **valid connected endorsement group**:\n- Every existing member receives a **5% health point increase**\n- The increase is calculated as:\n- **5% of their current health points**, plus\n- **5% of the new member’s health points**\nThis encourages:\n- Formation of **strong, connected networks**\n- Avoidance of risky or isolated endorsement chains"
    },
    {

      "question": "What should interns keep in mind while endorsing others?",
      "answer": "- Avoid careless, bulk, or reciprocal endorsements\n- Ensure your endorsement chain **connects to a Jedi**\n- Endorse based on **knowledge, effort, and contribution**\n- Be mindful that poor endorsements can cause **audit cascades**\nThe Self-Healing Endorsement Network rewards **integrity, collaboration, responsibility, and accountability**.\n<!-- **11.13 Will Bhavna ma’am conduct Viva sessions in the future so that interns can become Jedi (Bronze ticket holders)?**\nNo, Bhavna ma'am will unfortunately **not conduct Viva sessions anymore**. She will only perform audit checks in the form of viva to identify defaulters/anomalies.\nEarlier, clearing the Viva conducted by Bhavna ma’am allowed interns to become **Bronze ticket holders**. Since this process has now been discontinued, the **set of existing Jedi (Silver, Bronze, and Gold ticket holders) is fixed**.\nNo new Jedi will be added through Viva going forward. -->"
